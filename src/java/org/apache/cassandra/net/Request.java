/**
 * A request message for the inter-node messaging protocol.
 * <p>
 * Note that all requests are of this type, but it has two noticeable sub-classes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link OneWayRequest} for one-way requests, to which no response is sent.</li>
 *     <li>{@link ForwardRequest} for requests that are forwarded (see below), i.e. for which the response shouldn't be
 *     sent to the source of the message.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The messaging service has a forwarding mechanism for requests. A request can be created with "forwards", that is
 * essentially a list of nodes to which the request destination should forward the request to (on top of handling the
 * request itself that is). This is used to save cross-datacenter bandwidth when sending requests with large payload
 * (essentially mutations currently), by sending a request to only one node of remote DCs, but having that node forward
 * the request to any other node that needs to receive the request in the same datacenter. Every receiver then sends
 * its response directly to the originator of the request.
 * <p>
 * In practice, one can enable this forwarding by using a forwarding {@link Dispatcher} (created with
 * {@link Verb#newForwardingDispatcher}). In that case, on the sender, only a single request per remote datacenter will
 * be created, but that request will include a list of {@link Forward}. A receiver of a request with "forwards" will
 * both execute the request but also send a {@link ForwardRequest} to each node for which there is a {@link Forward}
 * (see {@link MessageDeliveryTask#run} for details). Each receiver of a {@link ForwardRequest} will execute the
 * request normally but will sent his response to the node that originated the operation, not the one having sent
 * the {@link ForwardRequest} to it (see {@link ForwardRequest#respond}).
 *
 * @param <P> the type of the payload of this request.
 * @param <Q> the type of the payload for the responses to this request.
